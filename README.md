Crop detection using Deep Learning Project

This thesis addresses the problem of:

"Developing a deep learning model to classify crop types using multispectral satellite imagery, trained and validated on the SICKLE dataset, to support precision agriculture practices in India."

The model is expected to generalize well to diverse crop types and field conditions while utilizing the full spectral depth of satellite images.

The primary objectives of this thesis are as follows:
1. To explore and preprocess multispectral satellite images for field-level crop detection.
2. To implement a CNN-based deep learning model tailored for 6-band .tif imagery.
3. To evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. To interpret the results through visualizations like confusion matrices, t-SNE plots, and spectral band heatmaps.
5. To reflect on the limitations of the approach and identify future directions for improvement and application.
